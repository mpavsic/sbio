	abstract = {By analyzing almost 120 000 dinucleotides in over 2000 nonredundant nucleic acid crystal structures, we define 96+1 diNucleotide Conformers, NtCs, which describe the geometry of RNA and DNA dinucleotides. NtC classes are grouped into 15 codes of the structural alphabet CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids) to simplify symbolic annotation of the prominent structural features of NAs and their intuitive graphical display. The search for nontrivial patterns of NtCs resulted in the identification of several types of RNA loops, some of them observed for the first time. Over 30\% of the nearly six million dinucleotides in the PDB cannot be assigned to any NtC class but we demonstrate that up to a half of them can be re-refined with the help of proper refinement targets. A statistical analysis of the preferences of NtCs and CANA codes for the 16 dinucleotide sequences showed that neither the NtC class AA00, which forms the scaffold of RNA structures, nor BB00, the DNA most populated class, are sequence neutral but their distributions are significantly biased. The reported automated assignment of the NtC classes and CANA codes available at dnatco.org provides a powerful tool for unbiased analysis of nucleic acid structures by structural and molecular biologists.}}

	title = {Dictionary of protein secondary structure: Pattern recognition of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features},
	volume = {22},
	year = {1983},
	abstract = {Abstract For a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns ``turn'' and ``bridge.'' Repeating turns are ``helices,'' repeating bridges are ``ladders,'' connected ladders are ``sheets.'' Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain ``chirality'' is the torsional handedness of four consecutive Cα positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as ``bends.'' Solvent ``exposure'' is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. The dictionary is also available in computer-readable form for protein structure prediction work.}}

Parameters of the pattern recognition procedure were optimized using designations provided by the crystallographers as a standard-of-truth. Comparison to the currently most widely used technique DSSP by Kabsch and Sander (Biopolymers 22:2577-2637, 1983) shows that STRIDE and DSSP assign secondary structural states in 58 and 31\% of 226 protein chains in our data sample, respectively, in greater agreement with the specific residue-by-residue definitions provided by the discoverers of the structures while in 11\% of the chains, the assignments are the same. STRIDE delineates every 11th helix and every 32nd strand more in accord with published assignments.}}

	abstract = {The present paper describes the {\it SSM} algorithm of protein structure comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original procedure of matching graphs built on the protein's secondary-structure elements, followed by an iterative three-dimensional alignment of protein backbone C_\alpha atoms. The {\it SSM} results are compared with those obtained from other protein comparison servers, and the advantages and disadvantages of different scores that are used for structure recognition are discussed. A new score, balancing the r.m.s.d. and alignment length N_{\rm align}, is proposed. It is found that different servers agree reasonably well on the new score, while showing considerable differences in r.m.s.d. and N_{\rm align}.}}

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the current update on macromolecular model validation services that are provided at the MolProbity website, emphasizing changes and additions since the previous review in 2010. There have been many infrastructure improvements, including rewrite of previous Java utilities to now use existing or newly written Python utilities in the open-source CCTBX portion of the Phenix software system. This improves long-term maintainability and enhances the thorough integration of MolProbity-style validation within Phenix. There is now a complete MolProbity mirror site at http://molprobity.manchester.ac.uk. GitHub serves our open-source code, reference datasets, and the resulting multi-dimensional distributions that define most validation criteria. Coordinate output after Asn/Gln/His ``flip'' correction is now more idealized, since the post-refinement step has apparently often been skipped in the past. Two distinct sets of heavy-atom-to-hydrogen distances and accompanying van der Waals radii have been researched and improved in accuracy, one for the electron-cloud-center positions suitable for X-ray crystallography and one for nuclear positions. New validations include messages at input about problem-causing format irregularities, updates of Ramachandran and rotamer criteria from the million quality-filtered residues in a new reference dataset, the CaBLAM Cα-CO virtual-angle analysis of backbone and secondary structure for cryoEM or low-resolution X-ray, and flagging of the very rare cis-nonProline and twisted peptides which have recently been greatly overused. Due to wide application of MolProbity validation and corrections by the research community, in Phenix, and at the worldwide Protein Data Bank, newly deposited structures have continued to improve greatly as measured by MolProbity's unique all-atom clashscore.}}

It reconstructs the status of protein X-ray crystallography at the time Kendrew entered the field in 1945, after distinctive service in operational research during the war. It reflects on the choice of sperm whale myoglobin as research material. In particular, it highlights Kendrew's early use of digital electronic computers for crystallographic computations and the marshaling of other tools and approaches that made it possible to solve the structure at increasing resolution. The essay further discusses the role of models in structure resolution and their broader reception. It ends by briefly reviewing Kendrew's other contributions in the formation and institutionalization of molecular biology.}}

Bernal and Dorothy Hodgkin (then Dorothy Crowfoot) showed {$[$}Bernal, J. D. \& Crowfoot, D. Nature 133, 794--795 (1934){$]$} that proteins, when crystallized, would diffract X-rays to produce a complex pattern of spots. They knew that these patterns contained all the information needed to determine a protein--s structure but, frustratingly, that information could not be deciphered. By comparing patterns from crystals containing different heavy-metal atoms, Max Perutz and colleagues devised the approach that was to solve this riddle. In 1958, J. C. Kendrew et al. applied Perutz--s technique to produce the first three-dimensional images of any protein - myoglobin, the protein used by muscles to store oxygen.}}

In addition, emerging integrative or hybrid methods (I/HM) are producing structural models of huge macromolecular machines and assemblies, sometimes containing 100s of millions of non-hydrogen atoms. The performance requirements for visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.}}}

APBS addresses the three key technology challenges for understanding solvation and electrostatics in biomedical applications: accurate and efficient models for biomolecular solvation and electrostatics, robust and scalable software for applying those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms for sharing and analyzing biomolecular electrostatics data in the scientific community. To address new research applications and advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in 2001. In this article, we discuss the models and capabilities that have recently been implemented within the APBS software package including a Poisson--Boltzmann analytical and a semi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph theory-based algorithm for determining pKa values, and an improved web-based visualization tool for viewing electrostatics.}}

Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default parameters are chosen to encourage best practice.
